#                                       Implementing Trivy on Terraform Modules using CircleCI

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Trivy, a popular vulnerability scanner for containers and applications, into your Terraform module development workflow using CircleCI. With Trivy, you can proactively identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in your dependencies and base images, helping you maintain a secure infrastructure.

## Overview
Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner that scans your container images and filesystems to find vulnerabilities in the packages and libraries you're using. By integrating Trivy into your CI/CD pipeline, you can automatically check your Terraform modules and their dependencies for known security issues before deploying them to production.

## Features
Scans your Terraform modules and their dependencies for vulnerabilities.
Integrates with CircleCI for automated scanning as part of your CI/CD process.
Provides detailed reports on vulnerabilities found, including severity levels.
Enables you to take proactive measures to address vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
Terraform installed locally.
A CircleCI account.
Docker installed on your local machine (for testing).
An AWS account (if you're using AWS resources in your Terraform modules).

## Getting Started
Clone this Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/MahiraTechnology/Mahira-medium.git
cd trivy
Configure CircleCI: Set up a new project on CircleCI that tracks your forked GitHub repository. In CircleCI, you'll need to add environment variables for any secrets, such as AWS credentials, that your Terraform modules use.

Customize Trivy Configuration: Customize the Trivy configuration file (trivy-config.yaml) to specify which image(s) you want to scan and the severity levels to consider.

Adapt CircleCI Configuration: Modify the .circleci/config.yml file to match your project's structure and requirements. Ensure that it includes the Trivy scan step in your workflow.

Commit and Push: Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.

Trigger a CircleCI Build: Pushing to your repository should trigger a CircleCI build automatically. Monitor the build progress on the CircleCI dashboard.

Review Trivy Results: Once the build is complete, review the Trivy scan results in the CircleCI artifacts or integrate them into your preferred reporting system.

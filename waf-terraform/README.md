#                                                       Securing Your Applications: Deploying AWS WAF with Terraform

This repository provides Terraform code and guidelines for deploying AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to secure your applications running on AWS. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that can affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

## Introduction
Web applications are often the target of various attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. AWS WAF provides a set of security features to protect your web applications and APIs against these types of attacks. This repository aims to simplify the deployment of AWS WAF using Terraform.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

AWS Account: You should have an AWS account and appropriate permissions to create and manage AWS resources.

Terraform: Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from the Terraform website.

AWS CLI: Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and configure it with your AWS credentials. You can download it from the AWS CLI website.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-waf-terraform.git
cd waf-terraform

Initialize the Terraform working directory:
terraform init
Terraform Code
The Terraform code in this repository sets up the following AWS resources:

AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) WebACLs and Rules.
Association of WAF with Amazon CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers (ALBs).
You can customize the rules and conditions in the Terraform code to match your specific application requirements.

Custom Rules
You can add custom rules to your AWS WAF setup based on your application's needs. Custom rules can be defined in the Terraform code, and they typically involve specifying conditions to match against incoming requests and actions to take when conditions are met.

## Deployment
To deploy AWS WAF with Terraform, follow these steps:
Review and customize the Terraform code in this repository to match your application's requirements.
Run terraform init to initialize your working directory.
Run terraform plan to review the changes Terraform will make.
If the plan looks good, run terraform apply to create the AWS resources.

## Maintenance
To maintain your AWS WAF setup:
Regularly review and update your custom rules to adapt to changing security threats and application requirements.
Monitor AWS WAF logs and CloudWatch metrics to detect and respond to potential security issues.
Keep your Terraform code and AWS resources up to date with best practices and the latest AWS WAF features.

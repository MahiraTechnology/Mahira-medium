## GitHub Terraform
Are you looking to make your GitHub repositories even more discoverable by adding relevant topics? This Terraform project will help you do just that! By using Terraform, you can automatically enrich your repositories with topics, streamlining the process and ensuring that your projects are properly categorized.

### What is This?
This repository contains a Terraform configuration that allows you to define the topics for your GitHub repositories in code. You can specify which topics should be associated with each repository and manage these configurations with version control.

### How Does It Work?
Define Topics: In your Terraform configuration, specify the GitHub repository and the topics you want to associate with it.

Run Terraform: Execute the Terraform script to apply the configurations to your GitHub repositories.

Enrich Repositories: Terraform will communicate with GitHub's GraphQL API to add or update the topics for your repositories.

## Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
GitHub Token: You will need a GitHub personal access token with sufficient permissions to manage repository topics. Ensure you have this token ready.
Terraform Configuration: Customize the main.tf file to define the repositories and topics you want to set. Add your GitHub token to the github_token environment variable.
Initialize and Apply: Run terraform init and then terraform apply. Terraform will authenticate with your GitHub account and make the necessary updates.

terraform init
terraform apply

Verify Topics: Check your GitHub repositories to see the newly added topics. Your repositories are now enriched!

### Important Note
Make sure you handle your GitHub token securely, using environment variables or other secure methods to keep it confidential.

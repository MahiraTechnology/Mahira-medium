#                                                                   Streamlining Security: Integrating Snyk with CircleCI

## Overview
This repository provides a streamlined integration of Snyk with CircleCI to enhance the security of your projects. By combining the powerful security scanning capabilities of Snyk with the automated CI/CD workflows of CircleCI, you can ensure that your code is continuously checked for vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up this integration, make sure you have the following:

Snyk account: Sign up for Snyk if you don't have an account.
CircleCI account: Sign up for CircleCI if you don't have an account.
Snyk API Token: Obtain an API token from your Snyk account to authenticate the integration.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to integrate Snyk with CircleCI:
Configure Snyk API Token:
Obtain an API token from your Snyk account. This token will be used to authenticate the Snyk CLI in CircleCI. Ensure the token has the necessary permissions for scanning your projects.

Store Snyk API Token in CircleCI:
Add the Snyk API token as an environment variable in your CircleCI project settings. This ensures that the token is securely stored and can be accessed during the CI/CD pipeline.

Integrate Snyk CLI in CircleCI Configuration:
Modify your CircleCI configuration file (usually .circleci/config.yml) to include Snyk CLI commands. These commands will trigger Snyk scans as part of your build process.

version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:2020.01
    steps:
      - checkout
      - snyk/scan:
          token-variable: SNYK_TOKEN
          docker-image-name: YOUR DOCKER IMAGE
          target-file: "Dockerfile"
          fail-on-issues: false

Ensure that you replace $SNYK_TOKEN with the actual environment variable reference where you stored your Snyk API token.

Trigger Builds:
With the Snyk integration configured, every build in CircleCI will now include Snyk security scans. Monitor the build logs for Snyk scan results, and take necessary actions based on identified vulnerabilities.

#                                        Creating Amazon DynamoDB Table using CloudFormation Template

This repository provides a CloudFormation template to deploy an Amazon DynamoDB table effortlessly. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service offered by AWS, and CloudFormation is the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service to provision AWS resources.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine or directly download the CloudFormation template.
Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
Open the CloudFormation service.
Click "Create Stack" and select "With new resources (standard)".
Upload the downloaded CloudFormation template.
Fill in the required parameters such as table name, read and write capacity units, etc.
Click "Next" and configure any advanced settings or tags if needed.
Review the stack options and click "Create stack".
Wait for the stack creation to complete. You can monitor the progress in the CloudFormation dashboard.
Once the stack is created successfully, your DynamoDB table is ready to use.

## Template Structure
template.yml: The CloudFormation template itself.
parameters.json: Sample parameter file with placeholders for custom values.
Customization
Feel free to modify the template.yml and parameters.json to tailor the DynamoDB table to your specific needs. You can adjust settings such as read and write capacity units, key schema, provisioned throughput, etc.

## Deployment
You can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or any other preferred method to deploy this CloudFormation template.

## Using AWS CLI
Open your terminal.
Navigate to the directory containing the CloudFormation template and parameters file.
Use the following AWS CLI command to create the stack:
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name YourDynamoDBStackName --template-body file://template.yaml --parameters file://params.json

Monitor the stack creation progress using:
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name YourDynamoDBStackName

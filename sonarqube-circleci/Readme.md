## Introduction

Maintaining high code quality is crucial for any software project. SonarQube is a powerful tool for continuous code quality inspection, offering a wide range of features, including code analysis, code coverage, and code duplication detection.

This repository provides a step-by-step guide on integrating SonarQube into your CircleCI pipeline. By doing so, you can automatically analyze your codebase with every commit and pull request, ensuring that your code meets the highest quality standards.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **GitHub Repository**: You should have a GitHub repository for your project.
2. **CircleCI Account**: Sign up for a CircleCI account if you don't have one.
3. **SonarQube Server**: Set up a SonarQube server or use a hosted SonarQube service.

## Getting Started

To get started with this integration, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/MahiraTechnology/Mahira-medium.git

Configure your SonarQube server details in the CircleCI configuration file (.circleci/config.yml).

Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.

Set up your project in CircleCI and connect it to your GitHub repository.

Trigger your first build, and SonarQube analysis will automatically run as part of your pipeline.

Configuration
In the .circleci/config.yml file, you can customize the following parameters:

SONARQUBE_URL: The URL of your SonarQube server.
SONARQUBE_TOKEN: The authentication token to access your SonarQube server.
SONARQUBE_PROJECT_KEY: The unique key for your project in SonarQube.
SONARQUBE_PROJECT_NAME: The name of your project in SonarQube.
Make sure to keep your sensitive information, such as tokens and passwords, secure by using CircleCI environment variables.

Usage
Once you've set up the integration, every code commit or pull request in your GitHub repository will trigger a CircleCI build that includes SonarQube analysis. You can view the results and code quality reports in your SonarQube dashboard.

Continuously monitor and improve your code quality based on the feedback provided by SonarQube.

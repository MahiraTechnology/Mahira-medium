##  Introduction
Managing deployments of web applications, especially in a collaborative environment, can become complex and error-prone. AWS Amplify is a powerful platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and scale modern web applications. However, managing Amplify environments, branches, and deployment workflows manually can be cumbersome.

This repository provides a solution to automate the deployment of AWS Amplify applications using Terraform. By defining your application's infrastructure as code, you can easily version and manage your deployment environment, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
An AWS account and appropriate permissions. AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary credentials. Terraform installed on your local machine. An Amplify application set up and configured.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/MahiraTechnology/Mahira-medium.git

Navigate to the repository directory: cd amplify

###  Terraform Configuration
The Terraform configuration in this repository includes:
Amplify Backend Environment: Defines the backend environment for your Amplify application. Amplify App Environment: Creates an Amplify app and deploys resources using Amplify CLI. Amplify Custom Domains: Configures custom domains for your Amplify app.

#### Deployment Workflow
Set up your Amplify application in the amplify directory.
Configure your Terraform backend settings in main.tf.
Initialize Terraform: terraform init
Review and apply the Terraform changes: terraform apply
After the Terraform deployment, Amplify will automatically deploy your application based on the defined settings.

Customizing Deployment
You can customize the deployment by adjusting the variables in variables.tf and modifying the Terraform configuration. Additionally, explore the Amplify CLI documentation to understand how to modify your application's behavior.

## Cleaning Up
When you no longer need the resources created by this repository, you can remove them by running: terraform destroy

By orchestrating AWS Amplify deployments with Terraform, you can streamline and simplify the deployment process of your web applications. This repository serves as a foundation for managing Amplify deployments in a scalable and automated manner.

Feel free to adapt, modify, and extend this repository to fit your specific requirements. Happy deploying!

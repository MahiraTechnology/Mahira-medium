#               GitHub Actions Workflow for Node.js Package with MongoDB Integration

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow file for a Node.js package that integrates with MongoDB using a CloudFormation template. With this workflow, you can automate your Node.js application's build, test, and deployment process while ensuring MongoDB is set up and configured appropriately.

#   Workflow Overview
The workflow consists of the following steps:

Checkout Repository: The workflow starts by checking out your repository's code.
Set up Node.js: This step sets up the Node.js environment with the specified version.
Install Dependencies: Your Node.js project's dependencies are installed using npm or yarn.

Run Tests: Your tests are executed to ensure your Node.js application is functioning correctly.

CloudFormation Stack Deployment: A CloudFormation stack is deployed, which includes setting up MongoDB with predefined configurations.

Deployment: Your Node.js application is deployed using your preferred deployment method (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, etc.).

##   Prerequisites

Before you can use this workflow, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
A GitHub repository containing your Node.js application code.

A CloudFormation template configured for deploying MongoDB.

AWS credentials set up in your repository secrets for the workflow to access AWS services.

Your Node.js project should include a package.json file with necessary scripts for running tests and deploying the application.

##  Getting Started

Copy the .github/workflows/main.yml file from this repository to your own repository in the same directory.

Configure the CloudFormation template and deployment process according to your application's requirements. Make sure to update the CloudFormation stack name, MongoDB configuration, and deployment steps.

Commit and push the changes to your repository. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger for each push to your repository.

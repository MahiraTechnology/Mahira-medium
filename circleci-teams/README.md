## Introduction
Effective communication within a development team involves notifying team members about various events such as successful builds, test failures, deployment status, and more. CircleCI provides a flexible and powerful way to trigger notifications through various channels like Slack, email, and custom webhooks.
This guide aims to help you set up and customize notifications to keep your team informed and engaged throughout the development and deployment process.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

A CircleCI account (sign up at circleci.com)
A project set up on CircleCI that you want to configure notifications for
Microsoft Teams channel with webhook url configured.

### Getting Started

Setting Up Notifications
Setting up notifications in CircleCI typically involves two main steps:
Configuring CircleCI: In your CircleCI project settings, you can define when and how notifications should be triggered. This is done through the .circleci/config.yml file in your project repository. You can specify notification workflows for different events, such as builds, tests, or deployments.

Integrating with External Services: To send notifications to your team, you need to integrate CircleCI with external services like Slack, email providers, or custom webhooks. Each service may have specific configurations and credentials that you need to set up.

## Customizing Notifications
CircleCI offers various ways to customize notifications, including:

Filtering notifications based on branches or event types.
Including relevant information in notifications, such as commit messages or test results.
Creating custom notification templates to match your team's preferences.
Refer to the documentation in this repository for detailed instructions on how to customize notifications to best fit your team's needs.

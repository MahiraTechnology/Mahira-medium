#                   Adding Health Checks for Route 53 using Terraform

## Introduction
This repository provides Terraform configurations to set up health checks for your Amazon Route 53 DNS records. Health checks are essential for monitoring the availability and reliability of your resources, such as web servers or load balancers.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
Terraform: Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from terraform.io.
AWS Account: You must have an AWS account and configure your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials.

### Usage
Follow these steps to set up health checks for your Route 53 records:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-s3-iam.git
cd route-53-health_check

Update Variables:
Open the variables.tf file and update the variables according to your requirements. You can configure things like the health check interval, threshold, and more.

### Initialize Terraform:
Run the following command to initialize Terraform and download the necessary providers:
terraform init

### Preview Changes:
Use the terraform plan command to see what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure:
terraform plan

### Apply Changes:
If everything looks good in the plan, apply the changes to create your Route 53 health checks:
terraform apply

Verify Health Checks:
After applying the changes, you can go to the AWS Management Console to verify that the Route 53 health checks have been created as expected.

##### Cleanup (Optional):

If you want to remove the health checks, you can use the terraform destroy command:
terraform destroy

### Customization
You can customize this Terraform configuration to fit your specific use case. For example, you can add more health checks, change the check protocol, or modify the check endpoints.

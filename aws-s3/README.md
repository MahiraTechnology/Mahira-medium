#                                           Efficiently Managing S3 Buckets: Implementing Lifecycle Rules for S3 Bucket

Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step guide and Terragrunt code for efficiently managing your AWS S3 buckets by implementing lifecycle rules. With lifecycle rules, you can automate the transition and expiration of objects within your S3 buckets, helping you optimize storage costs and maintain data compliance.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

AWS Account: You need access to an AWS account to create and manage S3 buckets.
Terragrunt Installed: Install Terragrunt on your local machine.
AWS CLI Installed: Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine to interact with AWS resources.
AWS IAM Credentials: Ensure you have AWS IAM credentials configured with appropriate permissions for creating and managing S3 buckets.

## Getting Started
To get started with managing S3 buckets using lifecycle rules, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/MahiraTechnology/Mahira-medium.git
cd aws-s3/life-cycle_rule

Initialize Terragrunt within the project directory:
terragrunt init

Modify the terragrunt.hcl file to define your S3 bucket and the desired lifecycle rules. You can refer to the Terragrunt Configuration section for guidance on defining lifecycle rules.

Apply your Terragrunt configuration to create the S3 bucket and associated lifecycle rules:

terragrunt apply
Validate that the S3 bucket and lifecycle rules are correctly configured in your AWS account.

Usage
You can modify the Terragrunt configuration to suit your specific use case. Refer to the AWS S3 documentation and Terragrunt documentation for additional configuration options and advanced use cases.

Lifecycle Rule Examples
Archiving to Glacier: Transition objects to the Glacier storage class after a certain number of days to reduce storage costs.

Object Expiration: Automatically delete objects after a specified retention period to comply with data retention policies.

Intelligent Tiering: Use lifecycle rules to leverage S3 Intelligent-Tiering to optimize storage costs based on object access patterns.

Custom Logging: Archive access logs to a separate bucket for auditing and compliance purposes.
